# Twine-Minigame-2

I knew that i wanted to make a simple game, so i decided a simple riddle game for the player to sate their curiosity, for the first two loops when you chose to go back to the start its due to getting it incorrect, after getting one right and choosing to leave the player character would be unsatified with the result and still curious so they'd re-enter as the loop.
